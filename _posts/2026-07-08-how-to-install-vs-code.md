# Introduction

As you might know, VSCode documentation is SUCKS (for those who are too lazy to read). So I made this article for myself and my readers (if there are any), on how to install VSCode easily.

## Tutorial

First, you need to:
### Select Your OS
- [Windows](#windows)
- [Linux](#linux)
- [Raspberry Pi](#raspberry-pi)
- [Mac](#mac)

## Windows
1. Head to this link [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

2. Then, click the Windows 10/11 Download section. <img src="/assets/img/os/vscode_w.png" alt="drawing" width="320"/>

3. After that open the installer, then just click Next, Next, Next until done.

4. Launch from menu, then you're done!

## Linux

Tested on Debian 13 (Trixie)



### 1. Update your system
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget gpg apt-transport-https
```

### 2. Import Microsoft's GPG key
```
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc \
| gpg --dearmor \
| sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
```

### 3. Add the Visual Studio Code repository
```
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
```

### 4. Install VS Code
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

### And donee!
To launch, simply type in terminal:
```
code
```
or launch from your main menu.
